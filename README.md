In this repository you will find:

* Proof-of-Concept (namedown.py)
* Metasploit Auxiliary Module (namedown.rb)


- Usage:

 - 1 Edit namedown.py, change TAEGET to your dns server's IP as well as port.
 - 2 Run namedown.py. Having python installed, do 'python namedown.py'.
    If your dns server down, it seems you need the CVE-2016-2776 patch from ISC.
    If your dns server doesn't down, shows it's ok.
    Therefore, this can serve as a tool to test CVE-2016-2776.patch's performance.
 - 3 Notice that, namedown.py will send only one special query to target dns server.
    If the server turns down, which is due to assert failure, says it.
